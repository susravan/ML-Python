# ML-Python

This folder contains all of my python code used to implement algorithms and solving different problems related to ML.

language_detection.py - Distinguishes between English, Spanish, German and French languages given atleast one word with more than three characters
Implementation: Looked up for the most commonly used words from respective languages and used that corpus of text for classification of language
Words that are less than length three are ignored as may not result in good classification.
